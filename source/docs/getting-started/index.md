### Hexo Installation

If this is your first time using Hexo, you can take some time to review the Hexo Docs to see [how to install Hexo](https://hexo.io/docs/) and [initialize a site](https://hexo.io/docs/setup). After the installation is successful, you should be able to execute `hexo` (or `npx hexo`) on the command line, and there must be `package.json`, `source`, `themes` and other directories in your {% label info@site root directory %}:

```bash
$ cd hexo-site
$ ls
_config.yml  node_modules  package-lock.json  package.json  scaffolds  source  themes
```

{% note info %}
If you are new to Node.js or Hexo, you can also modify the source code of an existing Hexo website instead of creating a new one, to help you understand how Hexo works. In fact, the document you are reading is generated by Hexo with NexT, and you can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/next-theme/theme-next-docs
$ cd theme-next-docs
$ npm install
```

{% endnote %}

Make sure that you have installed Hexo and created a site with it successfully, because the following documents require you to operate in the {% label info@site root directory %}.

### NexT Installation

The detailed steps to install or upgrade the theme are as follows.

#### Downloading NexT

It's easy to install Hexo theme: you can choose to install the theme through npm, or download the source code of the theme in the `themes` directory under {% label info@site root directory %}.

{% tabs downloading-next %}
<!-- tab Using <code>npm</code> -->
If you're using Hexo 5.0 or later, the simplest way to install is through npm.

Open your Terminal, change to Hexo {% label info@site root directory %} and install NexT theme:

```bash
$ cd hexo-site
$ npm install hexo-theme-next
```
<!-- endtab -->

<!-- tab Using <code>git</code> -->
If you know about [Git](https://git-scm.com), you can clone the whole repository and update it in any time with `git pull` command instead of downloading archive manually.

Open your terminal, change to Hexo {% label info@site root directory %} and clone the latest master branch of NexT theme:

```bash
$ cd hexo-site
$ git clone https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-theme-next themes/next
```
<!-- endtab -->
{% endtabs %}

{% note primary %}
You can also read [detailed installation instructions](/docs/getting-started/installation.html) if you want any other installation variant.
{% endnote %}

#### Upgrading NexT

A new version of NexT will be released every month. Please read the [release notes](https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-theme-next/releases) before updating the theme. You can update NexT by the following command.

{% tabs upgrading-next %}
<!-- tab Using <code>npm</code> -->
Install the latest version through npm:

```bash
$ cd hexo-site
$ npm install hexo-theme-next@latest
```
<!-- endtab -->

<!-- tab Using <code>git</code> -->
Or update to the latest master branch:

```sh
$ cd hexo-site
$ cd themes/next
$ git pull origin master
```

When running `git pull`, you can bypass merge conflicts (error message like **«Commit your changes or stash them before you can merge»**) by using the `Commit`, `Stash` or `Reset` commands for local changes. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15745424/5861495) how to do it.
<!-- endtab -->
{% endtabs %}

{% note warning %}
If you are still using NexT version 5 or 7, you can read [instructions for upgrading from legacy version](/docs/getting-started/upgrade.html).
{% endnote %}

### Configuration Files

After the installation of Hexo and NexT, you may found that there are two configuration files using by Hexo and both called `_config.yml`:

1. The first one is under {% label info@site root directory %}, which contains Hexo's config.
2. The second one is under {% label primary@theme root directory %} (e.g. `themes/next/_config.yml` or `node_modules/hexo-theme-next/_config.yml`), which is provided by NexT and contains theme's config.

Let's call the first one – {% label info@Hexo config file %}, and the second one – {% label primary@NexT config file %}.

{% note warning %}
However, we do not recommend directly modifying the {% label primary@NexT config file %}. It is quite often running into conflict status when updating NexT theme via `git pull`, or need to merge configurations manually when upgrading to new releases. For the theme installed through npm, it is also difficult to modify the {% label primary@NexT config file %} in `node_modules`.

In order to resolve this issue, we recommend using the [Alternate Theme Config](/docs/getting-started/configuration.html) feature to configure theme NexT.
{% endnote %}

### Hexo Configuration

The following settings in {% label info@Hexo config file %} are very helpful for optimizing your website.

#### Configuring Author

Edit {% label info@Hexo config file %} and set the value of `author` to your nickname.

```yml Hexo config file
# Site
author:
```

#### Configuring Description

Edit {% label info@Hexo config file %} and set the value of `description` to your description, which can be a sentence you like.

```yml Hexo config file
# Site
description:
```

#### Enabling NexT

Like all Hexo themes, after you download it, open {% label info@Hexo config file %}, find `theme` option, and change its value to `next` (or another theme directory name).

```yml Hexo config file
theme: next
```

Now you have installed NexT theme and enabled it. The following steps will help you verify whether NexT is enabled correctly.

### Checking NexT

It's recommended to use `hexo clean` to clean Hexo's cache first.
Then start Hexo local server with debug parameter (by adding `--debug`), the whole command is `hexo s --debug`. You can see the output while running, and if you find problem, you can use the output to help others locate error better. When it prints:

```
INFO  Hexo is running at http://localhost:4000/. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

Now you can open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser, and check whether the site works correctly.

{% note success %}
If you find your site looks like this picture, you have installed it correctly. That's default NexT scheme – Muse.

{% endnote %}

After that we can [configure deployment](/docs/getting-started/deployment.html).

If everything is OK, in next steps we will change some settings including [personalization](/docs/theme-settings/) and [third-party services integration](/docs/third-party-services/).
