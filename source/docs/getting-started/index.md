### Hexo Installation

If this is your first time using Hexo, make sure you have the environment set up correctly. To get started, you need to:

1. **Install Node.js**: You can download the installer from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/), use the package management tool included with your operating system, or use a Node.js version management tool like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). After installation, you should be able to execute `node` and `npm` commands in the command line.

2. **Install Hexo CLI globally**: Run `npm i -g hexo-cli`. After this, you should be able to execute the `hexo` command in the command line.

3. **Initialize a Hexo site**: Execute `hexo init hexo-site`. You can replace `hexo-site` with another path name, but this document will use `hexo-site` as an example. This directory will be referred to as the {% label info@site root directory %} in the following text.

Ensure you have a reliable internet connection during the installation process. If you encounter any issues, consider configuring a proxy for npm or git, or using mirror sites.

For more detailed installation steps, please refer to the Hexo Docs to see [how to install Hexo](https://hexo.io/docs/) and [initialize a site](https://hexo.io/docs/setup). After the installation is successful, you should be able to execute `hexo` (or `npx hexo`) on the command line, and there must be `package.json`, `source`, `themes` and other directories in your {% label info@site root directory %}:

```bash
$ cd hexo-site
$ ls
_config.yml  node_modules  package-lock.json  package.json  scaffolds  source  themes
```

{% note info %}
If you are new to Node.js or Hexo, you can also modify the source code of an existing Hexo website instead of creating a new one, to help you understand how Hexo works. In fact, the document you are reading is generated by Hexo with NexT, and you can install it with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/next-theme/theme-next-docs
cd theme-next-docs
npm install
```

{% endnote %}

Make sure that you have installed Hexo and created a site with it successfully, because the following documents require you to operate in the {% label info@site root directory %}.

### NexT Installation

The detailed steps to install or upgrade the theme are as follows.

#### Downloading NexT

It's easy to install Hexo theme: you can choose to install the theme through npm, or download the source code of the theme in the `themes` directory under {% label info@site root directory %}.

{% tabs downloading-next %}
<!-- tab Using <code>npm</code> -->
If you're using Hexo 5.0 or later, the simplest way to install is through npm.

Open your Terminal, change to Hexo {% label info@site root directory %} and install NexT theme:

```bash
cd hexo-site
npm install hexo-theme-next
```
<!-- endtab -->

<!-- tab Using <code>git</code> -->
If you know about [Git](https://git-scm.com), you can clone the whole repository of NexT theme.

Open your terminal, change to Hexo {% label info@site root directory %} and clone the latest master branch of NexT theme:

```bash
cd hexo-site
git clone https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-theme-next themes/next
```
<!-- endtab -->
{% endtabs %}

{% note primary %}
You can also read [detailed installation instructions](/docs/getting-started/installation.html) if you want any other installation variant.
{% endnote %}

#### Upgrading NexT

The NexT theme will continue to release new versions to include new features and bug fixes. Please read the [release notes](https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-theme-next/releases) before updating the theme. You can update NexT by the following command.

{% tabs upgrading-next %}
<!-- tab Using <code>npm</code> -->
If you have installed NexT theme through npm, you can upgrade it to the latest version by re-installing it:

```bash
cd hexo-site
npm install hexo-theme-next@latest
```

Note that any local changes to the theme inside `node_modules` directory will be lost when you run `npm install`. If you have made changes to the theme, you should back up the changes before running `npm install`, and then restore the changes after the installation is complete.

It's not recommended to modify the theme files in `node_modules` directory. To customize the theme, you can use the [Custom Files](/docs/advanced-settings/custom-files.html) feature.
<!-- endtab -->

<!-- tab Using <code>git</code> -->
After a new version of the theme is released, you can use `git pull` to update it to the latest master branch:

```sh
cd hexo-site
cd themes/next
git pull origin master
```

If you have made changes to the theme, you may encounter merge conflicts (error message like **«Commit your changes or stash them before you can merge»**) when running `git pull`. You can bypass merge conflicts by using the `Commit`, `Stash` or `Reset` commands for local changes. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15745424/5861495) how to do it.

If you don't like the newer version, you can also use `git` to revert to an old version at any time.
<!-- endtab -->
{% endtabs %}

{% note warning %}
If you are still using NexT version 5 or 7, you can read [instructions for upgrading from legacy version](/docs/getting-started/upgrade.html).
{% endnote %}

### Configuration Files

After completing the installation of Hexo and the NexT theme, you can customize your blog by modifying the configuration files. When you install Hexo, the accompanying configuration file is located in the {% label info@site root directory %} of your blog and is named `_config.yml`; we refer to this as the {% label info@Hexo config file %}. The configuration file for the NexT theme needs to be created by you; please create a `_config.next.yml` file in the {% label info@site root directory %}, which we will refer to as the {% label primary@NexT config file %} in the following text. If you have installed other themes, then the configuration files for those themes will also follow the naming convention of `_config.[name].yml`.
After creating an empty `_config.next.yml` file, you can copy the default configuration options from the theme's folder over to it, so you can refer to them for modifications and customization. Depending on your installation method, the NexT theme's default configuration file may be located in `themes/next/_config.yml` or `node_modules/hexo-theme-next/_config.yml`.
In simple terms, if you are installing the NexT theme for the first time, you can execute the following command to obtain a usable NexT configuration file:
```bash
# Installed through npm
cp node_modules/hexo-theme-next/_config.yml _config.next.yml
# Installed through Git
cp themes/next/_config.yml _config.next.yml
```

{% note warning %}
Please be aware that some other documents or tutorials may suggest creating or directly modifying files such as `themes/next/_config.yml` and `node_modules/hexo-theme-next/_config.yml`. Indeed, doing so can be accepted by Hexo and serve as your theme configuration file. However, this approach can lead to many inconveniences. For example, when upgrading the theme, custom modifications made to these default configuration files may lead to conflicts or be overwritten, causing data loss. Therefore, please use the previously introduced `_config.next.yml` file as the theme's configuration file, and avoid creating or modifying other theme configuration files to prevent conflicts.

For more information, please refer to [Alternate Theme Config](/docs/getting-started/configuration.html) feature documentation.
{% endnote %}

### Hexo Configuration

The following settings in {% label info@Hexo config file %} are very helpful for optimizing your website.

#### Configuring Author

Edit {% label info@Hexo config file %} and set the value of `author` to your nickname.

```yml Hexo config file
# Site
author:
```

#### Configuring Description

Edit {% label info@Hexo config file %} and set the value of `description` to your description, which can be a sentence you like.

```yml Hexo config file
# Site
description:
```

#### Enabling NexT

Like all Hexo themes, after you download it, open {% label info@Hexo config file %}, find `theme` option, and change its value to `next` (or another theme directory name).

```yml Hexo config file
theme: next
```

Now you have installed NexT theme and enabled it. The following steps will help you verify whether NexT is enabled correctly.

### Checking NexT

It's recommended to use `hexo clean` to clean Hexo's cache first.
Then start Hexo local server with debug parameter (by adding `--debug`), the whole command is `hexo s --debug`. You can see the output while running, and if you find problem, you can use the output to help others locate error better. When it prints:

```
INFO  Hexo is running at http://localhost:4000/. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

Now you can open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser, and check whether the site works correctly.

{% note success %}
If you find your site looks like this picture, you have installed it correctly. That's default NexT scheme – Muse.
![Default Scheme – Muse](/images/next-default-scheme.png)
{% endnote %}

After that we can [configure deployment](/docs/getting-started/deployment.html).

If everything is OK, in next steps we will change some settings including [personalization](/docs/theme-settings/) and [third-party services integration](/docs/third-party-services/).
